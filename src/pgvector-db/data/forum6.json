The novel idea behind Whales Market is centered on the inherent risks of\npeer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading.\n\nFormal methods like social groups, private messages, or decentralized platforms have long been known as the major methods to\nfacilitate OTC trading within the crypto space. Despite being recognized for the accessibility and convenience they have proven,\nthe negative impact of the lack of robust management on the asset transferring procedure has. This exposes traders to scams and\nfraud, where sellers may fail to deliver promised tokens. The main reason for this is because these tradings don't require any\ncommitment amongst the parties involved, as the trading routes between them are not porous and most likely based on the routes\nbetween both parties Whales Market addresses this issue by bringing OTC trading onto a single platform. This allows buyers and\nsellers to facilitate mutually agreed upon on-chain transactions. Capital remains locked in smart contracts and is only released\nto the parties upon successful transaction settlement. This advancement not only streamlines the trading process but also\nsignificantly reduces the risk of financial losses due to deceptive practices.\n\n⭐Pre Markets [/pre-markets/about-pre-markets]🔓Vesting Market [/vesting-market/vesting-market]⭐Point Markets\n[/point-markets/about-point-markets]\nNext$WHALES tokenomics [/overview/usdwhales-tokenomics]\n\nLast updated 1 month ago\n\nPage cover image\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FZsqHXwatHSgMwv1HhV5G%252FFrame%25201597880895.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9563e0c3-621e-461e-b7f0-3acd44e46de5&width=1248&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=f59da1b4&sv=2]",

The fee is then utilized\nfor:\n\n 1. Revenue-sharing: 60% of the fees collected is redistributed to $WHALES token stakers.\n\n 2. Development expenses: 20% is allocated to cover ongoing development expenses\n\n 3. Buyback and Burn: 10% is used to buy back and burn tokens, creating deflationary pressure.\n\n 4. $LOOT revenue-sharing: 10% is shared to $LOOT stakers and $xLOOT holders.\n\nEMISSION STRATEGY\n\n$WHALES emission is designed to decay over time, ensuring early adopters are rewarded while controlling inflation.\n\n> Performance-based Emissions: emissions are tied to certain KPIs in terms of volume traded to ensure that emissions lead to\n> protocol growth.\n\n$WHALES holders can vote on these KPIs in a decentralized manner. This is also in line with the aim to reach a sustainable balance\nwhere revenue from fees is higher than $WHALES emissions.\n\nPrevious$WHALES tokenomics [/overview/usdwhales-tokenomics]NextIncentive Progam [/overview/usdwhales-tokenomics/incentive-progam]\n\nLast updated 8 months ago",

These fees are then distributed to $WHALES stakers\n(60%).\n\nWhen users stake $WHALES, they receive $xWHALES, the staked derivative token. $xWHALES has two main functions:\n\n    \n\n 1. To receive revenue share\n\n    \n    \n\n 2. To be used as collateral across all OTC markets.\n\n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFEE COLLECTION AND REWARD DISTRIBUTION\n\n   \n\n * Fees are collected in various assets, depending on the blockchain (EVM, SOL, etc.) and the specific market.\n\n   \n   \n\n * To streamline the reward-claiming process, the protocol periodically converts these collected tokens into $WHALES tokens.\n\n   \n   \n\n * These transactions are transparent and can be viewed on the protocol's dashboard\n\n   \n   \n\n * The converted $WHALES tokens are then evenly distributed among the stakers as rewards.\n\n   \n\nSTAKING CONTRACT MECHANICS\n\nThe staking contract features a dual-asset pool, consisting of $WHALES and $xWHALES tokens.\n\n   \n\n * Users stake $WHALES tokens to receive $xWHALES tokens in return.\n\n   \n   \n\n * By holding $xWHALES tokens, stakers are entitled to a progressively increasing quantity of $WHALES rewards.\n\n   \n   \n\n * The increment in rewards is achieved through the continuous purchase of $WHALES tokens with the generated revenue, which will\n   then be allocated to the staking pool.\n\n   \n   \n\n * This process results in a healthy increase in the $xWHALES to $WHALES conversion rate, thereby augmenting the value for the\n   stakers.\n\n   \n   \n\n * This mechanism also prevents post-claim dumping of $WHALES, as rewards are paid out incrementally, rather than all at once.\n\n   \n\nWithdrawal\n\nStakers have the option to withdraw at any time, converting their $xWHALES back into $WHALES tokens.\n\nAlthough $xWHALES is tradable, at this stage there is no official liquidity pool on any Solana DEX. The conversion rate is only\nguaranteed through Whales staking.\n\nAlthough rev-share is paid out in $WHALES tokens, these $WHALES tokens are purchased off the open market in a transparent manner.\nTherefore, the rewards in the staking contract do not inflate the supply.\n\n$WHALES tokens from incentives allocation emissions are distributed separately to users, with a 4-year linear vesting schedule.\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FtllZBQuehc36pLGsraqM%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3De0099803-f375-409f-96f1-63ccc7636bbf&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=dc9be75&sv=2]",

Please adhere to any instructions given in this section. Linking your wallets across multiple\nnetworks plays a crucial role in trading on Whales Market.\n\n1. FOR CROSS-CHAIN SETTLEMENT [/pre-markets/settlement-rules/cross-chain-settlement-soon]:\n\nImagine you are purchasing Runstone (on the Bitcoin Network) with SOL (on Solana). The linking of your Solana wallet and Bitcoin\nwallet will facilitate the settlement.\n\nYou will receive Runstone in the exact Bitcoin wallet linked with your Solana address that you are using to fill the offer.\n\n2. FOR USER INCENTIVES [/overview/usdwhales-tokenomics/incentive-progam] & REFERRAL [/overview/referral-program] REWARDS:\n\nSince Whales Market's Incentives & Referral Rewards are accumulated based on the user's total trading volume across all supported\n8+ networks, linking wallets will facilitate accurate calculations of user contributions to the platform.\n\n⚡How to Link your Wallets?

[/overview/how-to-use-dashboard/link-your-wallets/how-to-link-your-wallets]NextThe mechanism\n[/whaleslock/the-mechanism]\n\nLast updated 22 days ago\n\nThe memecoin era is booming, but with more coins hitting the market than ever, it’s becoming harder to separate the true 1000x\ngems from the noise.\n\nAs barriers to launch have lowered, democratizing access to memecoins, the influx of options has created chaos and uncertainty for\npotential investors.\n\nWith so many coins flooding the space, it’s easy to get caught up in the hype cycles, and the constant price swings trigger our\ninner paperhands, making it difficult to hold strong.\n\nThat’s why we built WhalesLock, the ultimate trust engine for memecoin projects, created by the team behind Whales Market, the #1\nOTC marketplace in the space.\n\nHere’s what WhalesLock brings to the table:\n\n * Supply Locking: Memecoin developers can easily lock their token supply, showing serious commitment and preventing supply\n   manipulation.\n\n * Trust & Transparency: No more fearing dumps from whales or insider games. Locked supply builds trust and solidifies community\n   support, making it easier for us to hold with confidence.\n\n * Sustainable Price Growth: Locked tokens create natural buying pressure, keeping price action healthy and sustainable, reducing\n   the panic that leads to paperhanding.\n\nWhalesLock revolutionizes the memecoin landscape by prioritizing sustainable tokenomics and community-driven growth. Beyond being\na utility platform, we're pioneering a new standard where holder trust and organic community development replace the pump-and-dump\nculture, setting the foundation for the next evolution of memecoins. Let's dive into the details:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⭐About WhalesLock [/whaleslock/about-whaleslock]\n🛣️The mechanism [/whaleslock/the-mechanism]\n💰Lock your memecoin [/whaleslock/lock-your-memecoin]\n🤑Locking Rewards [/whaleslock/locking-rewards]\n💳Platform Fees [/whaleslock/platform-fees]",

It's all about who can front-run the\n   next guy and dodge the rugs. NGMI if you're slow - savage gains for those who know when to send it and when to exit. Basically\n   musical chairs but with your bags.\n\n * PvE MemeCoins (aka Cults): Based culture coins where diamond hand chads build the strongest floors. No paper hands allowed -\n   just vibing, sharing rare memes, and watching paperhands get rekt. WAGMI mentality where the whole squad holds through thicc\n   and thin. Real ones know - community is everything.\n\nWhalesLock revolutionizes memecoin tokenomics with advanced supply management and yield generation for both PvP and PvE\nstrategies.\n\nFor degen plays, it delivers sophisticated lock/unlock mechanics optimizing volatility and price action. For cults, it provides\nsustainable growth through strategic locks and auto-compounding rewards. Built on battle-tested Whales Market infrastructure,\nWhalesLock transforms locked supply into a powerful tool for both aggressive traders and long-term holders, combining verifiable\ncommitments with passive income generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FFVDSX3MlwNdWTC5ncg41%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D92da42da-8d10-4918-9b9a-2e295a5ee3b5&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=b71d947f&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252F9ucfx8rXZHqYAtm32fRS%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db539282d-897c-495d-b2a7-61f1c9c97f03&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=ebfa7082&sv=2]",

However, these methods often lack security measures, exposing traders to the risk of\nscams, with fraudsters failing to deliver promised tokens.\n\nWhales Markets revolutionizes this process with smart contracts, facilitating a mutually agreed on-chain transaction for both\nbuyers and sellers. This innovation not only makes trading more accessible but also significantly reduces the risk of financial\nloss due to fraud.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nBuy Token Allocation [/pre-markets/buy-token-allocation]Sell Token Allocation [/pre-markets/sell-token-allocation]\nSUPPORTED NETWORKS & TOKENS\n\n\n\n\n\n🟢\n🔴\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252Fj0RVUGogx9GDbmX8U3Ew%252F63488821daefa5bb07908ed9_WhatisSOL.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D765b22d9-7e06-488b-aa83-3040959c2aa4&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c85b6d1b&sv=2]\n\nJupiter\n\nWormhole\n\nWen\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FjfWNE0NQGOZMgGdKSqAD%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df6b1398c-3287-4451-ad0a-02c76f6973e4&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=95d10f9&sv=2]\n\nSmartLayer\n\nAltLayer\n\nAevo\n\nPixels\n\nEthena\n\nEtherfi\n\n\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FiNnfW54mKRlkOpWYwFSY%252F7f2421662ce829c42d6d66bfc20a90ca.jpeg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dae103fa0-bb69-4a6e-b6eb-3082472ef67b&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=3ccf0c1f&sv=2]\n\nPump\n\nGaimin\n\nPlaybux\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FUAKeLfasltQrKpZQpCbF%252FARTICLE-IMAGES-2023-02-24T121602.760-1200x628.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da67f1b6e-ff56-4b74-9ce8-260139c12c74&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9827102c&sv=2]\n\nSubQuery\n\n\n\n\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FsVTpdVX39DR4F8SarMEd%252Fsn_logo_banner.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D51ea1ec1-eb0c-4e8b-be4b-4be62f8d7d1b&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=303f9b44&sv=2]\n\nStarknet\n\nzkLend\n\n\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FVpVW52cmcnTV2anw9NJx%252Fmanta-network-social.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D4a970678-de82-4cc3-8301-14d43ab7eb02&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=12f5cd63&sv=2]\n\nMANTA\n\n\n\n\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FtNQ0U0Y4x7kLe1qIxWXu%252Fmc8sBrofzcoiauoCZ7wlC.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1d475ee3-798e-493e-8eff-5604834f2b88&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9af4b5ac&sv=2]\n\nZerolend\n\nFoxy\n\n\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FnE2828eKM4HSGgb9FYFU%252Farb.jpeg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D806c25bf-6b39-4038-8a97-a974e8579af4&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=42b699a8&sv=2]\n\nMorpheus\n\nAark\n\n\n\nCover\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FgxpSqJcummgPg6NLjNQb%252F65ea70818adc73f80d62e31a_What%2520is%2520Merlin%2520Chain_%2520%281%29.webp%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D8b8a1cca-8fdb-4c36-b04b-bdfc780e6e84&width=245&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=84f6d2f9&sv=2]\n\nMerlin",

Check more atSettlement Rules\n[/pre-markets/settlement-rules]\n\nHOW TO FIND OTHERS OFFER TO SELL?\n\nStep 1: On the Pre-Market dashboard, pick the listings that you want to buy\n\n\n\nStep 2: Choose the Offer-to-Sell that you want to fill\n\n\n\nThere are 2 types of offers for you to choose from:\n\n   \n\n * PARTIAL FILL: Multiple users can contribute to fulfill the offer.\n\n   \n   \n\n * SINGLE FILL: The entire offer must be filled by 1 user\n\n   \n\nStep 3: Deposit your funding to finalize your order. Then you're good to go!\n\n\n\nFYI: You can easily track your trading history through the My Orders section\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FI2pFNAMfng5piiEozKkK%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3De37bdfd3-c5b8-4a94-88d9-f217b563f55f&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=e7fd8cda&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252F2RwOTRmbOl4L0h2JoRyS%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D4906a0b0-dd02-4039-ba99-ef035d8bf52d&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=63cc5963&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FXCWEKPJPZabfGvnmGRR6%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dae556c6e-9294-4be2-ad52-863269d5d132&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=ea0aa07&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FE8iC4Jx4Kvcse2djAHI0%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D85fadae9-2a9e-4480-80be-1a1df89a9c96&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=dfad9575&sv=2]",

This function allows you to set your\nterms regarding price and quantity, giving you more control over the transaction.\n\n\n2. CLOSE YOUR OFFER (OPTIONAL)\n\nAdditionally, Pre-markets' smart contracts enable offer creators to close their offers before they are fully filled, allowing them\nto reclaim any remaining unfilled deposits.\n\nThis means you can close your offer-to-buy at any time, preventing any further fills by sellers, and retrieve your funds deposited\nfor purchasing tokens.\n\n\n\nPlease note, you can only reclaim the unfilled deposit amount, not the portion allocated for the filled orders from sellers - the\namount you were supposed to pay for the seller's filled order.\n\nIf nobody fills your offer after TGE, you can go to the dashboard and close your offer.\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FFy2KiyzorN5XsSJLIcf7%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D66375f97-3d61-4df2-8466-652554406cec&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=91eed405&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FpheG0AqPiuk9ArbkD9Kx%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D25bace8e-ac6d-44d6-ae42-eb028b9176fd&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=84088912&sv=2]",

Check more atSettlement Rules\n[/pre-markets/settlement-rules]\n\nHOW TO FIND OTHERS' OFFER TO BUY\n\nStep 1: On the Pre-Market dashboard, pick the listings that you want to buy\n\n\n\nStep 2: Grab your favorable order within the listing Order-to-Sell\n\n\n\nPARTIAL FILL: Multiple users can contribute to fulfill the offer.\n\nSINGLE FILL: The entire offer must be filled by 1 user\n\nStep 3: Deposit your funding to finalize your order. Then you're good to go!\n\n\n\nFYI: You can easily track your trading history through the My Orders section\n\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FAm8jc0ZTw8lC2zW7zCSq%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd62ac8b4-38ae-4eb8-86f7-d085e8b46460&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=126e759a&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FjTkO5SNOXQCIXCF31rwP%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D0dad66c7-f8ea-420b-9d73-41574950b7bc&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=5ec1ddc6&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FvZoWBZSCAjG4Dwh5z4O6%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D075a75ef-3155-45f7-a55b-941d482a36c2&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=1250bbf8&sv=2]",

CLOSE YOUR OFFER (OPTIONAL)\n\nJust as with the offer to buy, Whales Pre-markets' smart contracts allow sellers to close their offers before they are completely\nfilled, enabling the reclamation of any remaining unfilled collateral.\n\nThis means you can close your offer-to-sell at any time, stopping any further fills by buyers, and retrieve the funds you\ndeposited as collateral.\n\nPlease note, you can only reclaim the collateral for the unfilled deposit amount.\n\nThe portion allocated for the filled orders from buyers - the amount you were required to keep as collateral for the buyer's\nfilled order - cannot be reclaimed.\n\n\n\nIf nobody fills your offer after TGE, you can go to the dashboard and close your offer.\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252F0Kqi1huj9YWiHSDWqrOo%252FScreenshot%25202023-12-27%2520at%252018.02.04.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D87d1e7ab-c60f-4cc8-8954-f6d4e43b1cf9&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=30ba7a5d&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FY4WcG0knrAIIXukFDwJj%252FScreenshot%25202023-12-27%2520at%252018.07.04.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df8f33f04-cb1b-42ff-b60d-af9c7cd1915f&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=f7eed69d&sv=2]",

This means you risk losing your funds if you fail to settle in time.\n\n\nTO SETTLE MULTIPLE ORDERS, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nStep 1: Connect the wallet you created offers or filled orders (please make sure your wallet has token before settling).\n\nStep 2: Go to your dashboard, then select the orders you want to settle.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Double-check the total DYM and click the settle button to confirm. You also need to confirm the Smart Contract request on\nyour connected wallet.\n\n\n\nPlease wait for the system to verify your settlements. After completion, the status will be changed to settled.\n\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FdHCMpoePFr3FpnFQzKVO%252FScreenshot%25202023-12-27%2520at%252019.20.00.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D15115613-5e45-4c8b-832e-1af187b524f3&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=51d68f4c&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FakHCKrbNzdrilu0mEVqC%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D5583b410-e3b3-476f-b109-c70ac71dc03e&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=686a17b8&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FuRAZkqeIsWeyxHoe2WPR%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D90a603fa-d592-43f7-82f6-e005b129dfdc&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=82cbc829&sv=2]",

All transactions are smoothly settled within the smart contract. Buyers can put in their funds,\n> and sellers can deposit their assets directly into the contract for automated trading convenience.\n\nWHAT IF NOBODY FILL MY SELLING/ BUYING ORDERS ?\n\n> If nobody fills your offer after TGE, you can go to the dashboard and close your offer.\n\nDO I NEED TO PROVIDE MY WALLET + PRIVATE KEY TO BUYERS ?\n\n> Please note, you don't need to send your private key to anyone.\n\nWHAT'S THE COLLATERAL FOR SELLERS?\n\n> The seller's collateral ensures they'll provide tokens once they are released. If the sellers don't settle before the deadline,\n> their collateral goes to the buyer as compensation. Check detail here Settlement Rules [/pre-markets/settlement-rules]\n\nWhen are fees counted?\n\n> Fees are only incurred for three specific actions: closing an offer, settling an offer, and canceling an offer. Check details\n> here. Platform Fee [/pre-markets/platform-fee]\n\nWhat types of assets will be listed in the Pre-Market?\n\n> You can trade pre-TGE tokens or your airdrop allocations, secured by smart contracts for both parties.\n\nWhat will happen at TGE Time?\n\n> Please check detail here Settlement Rules [/pre-markets/settlement-rules]\n\nI filled a buy offer, but havent't received my tokens yet. What should i do?\n\n> Please note that after you fill the offer, you can't take any action until TGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousTechnical Overview [/pre-markets/technical-overview]NextInterpretation Error [/pre-markets/interpretation-error]\n\nLast updated 8 months ago",

While this paradigm proves advantageous for token issuers, it can concurrently limit\nthe potential for token holders to generate greater profits. Vesting schedules may restrict the capacity to leverage their\ncapitals for alternative ventures within the exhilarating and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency arena.\n\nWhales Market's vesting market offers holders the opportunity to proactively buy and sell vested tokens prior to their full\nrelease, enabling them to capitalize on potential profits without the constraint of conventional market liquidity. This innovative\napproach empowers users to optimize the yield potential of their existing assets and strategically manage their investment\nportfolios.\n\nVesting Market working as a trustless decentralized marketplace which allow users to seemlessly trading for the ownership of their\nvesting allocations.\n\nIn the initial stage, we will collaborate with Streamflow to verify the token vesting ownership of the sellers listed on Vesting\nMarket.\n\nHow to trade on the Vesting Market\n\nAt the very first stage, the\n\n\n\nPreviousListings Regulations [/pre-markets/listings-regulations]NextPlatform Fee [/vesting-market/platform-fee]\n\nLast updated 1 month ago",

Check more at Settlement Rules\n[/pre-markets/settlement-rules]\n\nHOW TO FIND OTHERS OFFER TO SELL?\n\nStep 1: On the Points-Market dashboard, pick the listings that you want to buy\n\n\n\nStep 2: Choose the Offer-to-Sell that you want to fill\n\n\n\nThere are 2 types of offers for you to choose from:\n\n   \n\n * PARTIAL FILL: Multiple users can contribute to fulfill the offer.\n\n   \n   \n\n * SINGLE FILL: The entire offer must be filled by 1 user\n\n   \n\nStep 3: Deposit your funding to finalized yoru order. Then you're good to go\n\n\n\nFYI: You can easily track your trading history through the My Orders section\n\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FoVRJJ8ESYE0e79GJCiIu%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df4785ce4-963d-4cbf-8691-4397a46cb0ad&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=6e422efd&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252Fgjyfflziwz2ehMqx4WBF%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9c86fbc4-d0dc-4fe7-9bcb-c7f84394fc43&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=b507f829&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FpELcvjIBnn2auxOwbHFC%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Deb820012-3141-498c-b59c-601cf07b7652&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=8f2e751c&sv=2]",

Check more at Settlement Rules\n[/point-markets/settlement-rules]\n\nHow to find others' Offer to Buy\n\nStep 1: On the Points Market dashboard, pick the listings that you want to buy\n\n\n\nStep 2: Grab your favorable order within the listing Order-to-Buy\n\n\n\nThere are 2 types of offers for you to choose from:\n\n   \n\n * PARTIAL FILL: Multiple users can contribute to fulfill the offer.\n\n   \n   \n\n * SINGLE FILL: The entire offer must be filled by 1 user\n\n   \n\nStep 3: Deposit your funding to finalize your order. Then you're good to go!\n\n\n\nFYI: You can easily track your trading history through the My Orders section\n\n\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FgcQBWFQOIVAQLbAzziTQ%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D18f4d7a9-e1c5-4d7d-ae41-e8fda1ac2ba7&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9c982646&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FSt7iTa62KEZtW1KAqhxL%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D437ed665-1a06-47e7-9167-b8043e8fc090&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=9e8c1b80&sv=2]\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252F0DwSRGpRCZYqdV2VPAH4%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9390bbf6-7d51-413a-85fe-82ebbdb77dd2&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=d678063e&sv=2]",

CREATE AN OFFER\n\nIn situations where the listed offer-to-buy doesn't align with your price expectations, or if the offered amount doesn't match\nwhat you're seeking, you're encouraged to create your own sell offer. This option allows you to define your own terms for price\nand quantity, providing greater control over the transaction.\n\n\n2. CLOSE YOUR OFFER (OPTIONAL)\n\nJust as with the offer to buy, Whales Pre-markets' smart contracts allow sellers to close their offers before they are filled,\nenabling the reclamation of any collateral.\n\nThis means you can close your offer-to-sell at any time, stop any fills by buyers, and retrieve the funds you deposited as\ncollateral.\n\nIf nobody fills your offer after TGE, you can go to the dashboard and close your offer.\n\n[https://docs.whales.market/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1927385578-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fx6BD7DBdJOnjDJswNoq9%252Fuploads%252FGYmngPuq6cJO5zbrXY2s%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D0a3a8838-a8dd-4978-862a-df5871471246&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=f02198a1&sv=2]",

We don't need any permission from any external entities to influence a\n   decision for listings.\n\n * We will announce each listing publicly via our Official Links [/additional-documents/official-links].\n\nDURING THE LISTING TIME\n\n * We only provide and manage the collaterals platform. We do not have any rights to manipulate any of the listings on our site.\n   Price movements are purely based on the trading activities of the users.\n\n * If you encounter difficulties creating buy or sell orders, kindly refer to the latest official announcement on our social media\n   channels Official Links [/additional-documents/official-links]\n\nDURING THE SETTLEMENT TIME\n\n * The conversion rate for each settlement phase in the points market has already been determined based on community sentiment,\n   projects offering rewarding points, and the current market conditions. We are committed to finding the most beneficial rate for\n   both buyers and sellers participating in specific listings.\n\n * We will kick-start the settlement time once the tokens are officially listed on any of the CEXs/DEXs. We will use the time of\n   the first exchange announcement listing those tokens as the start of our settlement phase.\n\n * For most listings, users will have 24 hours to settle their orders. We will only extend the settlement time in case of\n   unforeseen or unresolved technical issues, such as network congestion, minor delays, or postponed listing times on exchanges.\n\n * We will automatically unlist any listing that fails to reach a trading volume of $50,000 within 24 hours before the settlement\n   time. All deposited capital will be returned to the participants.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you regularly check your order status on our platform to stay informed about the latest updates\nregarding listings. We cannot be held responsible for any capital losses incurred due to user negligence.\n\nPreviousPlatform Fee [/point-markets/platform-fee]NextContract Audits [/additional-documents/contract-audits]\n\nLast updated 1 month ago",
