# Investment Position Mechanism

1. **Definition and Function:**
   * The investment position serves as the mechanism through which investors contribute capital to the AIIA Finance trading pool. Essentially, depositing USDT to the pool is equivalent to opening an investment position. Each position represents a proportionate share of the total trading capital. For example, if the total trading capital is $1,000,000 and an investor deposits 10,000 USD, they own 1% of the fund.
2. **Preferred Policies When Investing with AIIA:**
   * AIIA Finance offers several incentivized options for investors who choose to stake AIIA tokens or lock their investment positions:
     * Investors Already Staking X AIIA: Investors who are already staking a certain amount of AIIA are eligible for the discounted profit-sharing fee (20-80). This rewards existing AIIA stakers and encourages continued participation in the ecosystem.
     * Rewards for Locked Investments: In addition to the profit-sharing benefits, investors who lock their investment positions (locked for 3, 6, or 12 months) earn an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) reward. This provides an additional incentive for maintaining their investment and participating in the platform's growth. The staking rewards offer a passive income stream for long-term investors.
