2. **The Power of Compound Interest**

Example: A user invests in 10 NFTs (20 USD) and holds them for a very long time.

| Duration | Estimated Value                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 30 years | \~18,000 USD (Education fund)      |
| 40 years | \~173,000 USD (Insurance fund)     |
| 50 years | \~1,670,000 USD (Legacy for heirs) |

With compound interest, even a small amount can grow into a significant asset over time.

3. **NFT Holder Flow of Actions:**

* **Purchase NFT**: A pays 2 USD, and the system automatically creates the NFT.
* **Hold and stake**: The owner earns interest and VIP benefits.
* **Receive referral reward**: 0.2 USD is divided under the **R1 - R2** model.
* **Trade**: The NFT can be sold/transferred on **OpenSea**, and the new owner continues to enjoy its benefits.
* **Withdraw**: The NFT can be withdrawn by selling back directly to the platform. The value withdrawn will be the same as the compounded value of the NFT.
