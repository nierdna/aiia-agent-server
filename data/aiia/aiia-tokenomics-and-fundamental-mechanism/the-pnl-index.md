# The PnL Index

The PnL Index is derived directly from the performance of an internal trading fund, which has a fixed baseline of $100,000. The matching 1:1 mechanism means each point change in the PnL Index corresponds exactly to a 1% profit or loss calculated based on this fixed baseline amount of $100,000, rather than on the cumulative value of the fund.

**Example:**

* **Step 1 (Initial):**\
  The PNL Index starts at 100, corresponding to the initial baseline value of $100,000 for the internal fund.
* **Step 2 (When the fund gains profit):**\
  After some periods, the fund achieves a profit of $12,000, equivalent to 12% based on the original baseline of $100,000.\
  → The PnL Index thus increases by exactly 12 points, from 100 to **112**.
* S**tep 3 (When the fund incurs a loss):**\
  Suppose after this profitable period, the fund experiences a loss of $7,000, equivalent to 7%, still calculated against the original baseline of $100,000.\
  → The PnL Index then decreases by exactly 7 points, from 112 down to **105**.

In this way, the PNL Index always moves in direct proportion to percentage gains or losses based on the fixed $100,000 baseline. This transparent mechanism allows investors to easily monitor and calculate the fund’s real-time performance and clearly understand their investment outcomes.
