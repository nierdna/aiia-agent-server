# Multi-level Refferal

This referral system is designed to encourage investors to expand their network:

* Each participant receives a 6-character referral code.
* When someone purchases an NFT, the platform will keep 90% and the remaining 10% (0.2 USD) is distributed as follows:

| _**Recipient**_         | _**Commission Rate**_ | _**Amount**_ | _**Note**_                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Platform                | 90%                   | 1.8 USD      | Used to create the NFT     |
| R1 (direct referrer)    | 9%                    | 0.18 USD     | Person who directly refers |
| R2 (the referrer of R1) | 1%                    | 0.02 USD     | The referrer of R1         |
| Total                   | 100%                  | 2 USD        |                            |

Note:

* If there is only R1, R1 receives 0.18 USD; if there is no R2, the 0.02 USD portion is not further distributed.
* NFT bought directly from the AIIA platform: the remaining commission of 0.2 USD (10%) per NFT purchase goes back to the platform.

Airdrop Bonus for R1: In addition to a 9% commission (0.16 USD) from each NFT purchased by an invitee, R1 (the direct inviter) will also receive free AIIA tokens in the form of an airdrop. The number of bonus tokens is based on the total number of NFTs purchased by all of R1’s invitees:

* This bonus is accumulated from the total number of NFTs of all invitees.
* Condition: The total number of NFTs purchased by all invitees must reach at least 50 NFTs for R1 to receive the airdrop.

**How It Works**

1. Person C invites B to join, providing a referral code.
2. B uses C’s code to join and then invites A to purchase an NFT.
3. A buys an NFT for 2 USD:

* 1.8 USD goes to the platform to create the NFT.
* B (R1) receives 0.18 USD (9%) for referring A.
* C (R2) receives 0.02 USD (1%) for referring B.
