# AIIA Tokenomics

1.  **Supply and Distribution**

    * Fixed Total Supply: The total supply of AIIA tokens is capped at 100 million. Crucially, there will be no further minting of AIIA tokens, creating scarcity and potentially increasing its value over time.
    * Distribution Plan:
      * Seed Sale:
        * Percentage: 1.5% of the total supply (1.5 million tokens)
        * Fixed Price: $0.006 per token
        * Protection Mechanisms:
          * Tokens sold are locked in a smart contract to ensure safety and transparency.
          * If the fair launch price upon listing is below $0.006 per token, investors have the right to claim a refund.
      * Founding Team: 18.5% of the total supply (18.5 million tokens)
      * Marketing:
        * Percentage: 5% of the total supply (5 million tokens)
        * Objective: To implement an effective and responsible marketing strategy.
      * Airdrop (Community Rewards)
        * Percentage: 5% of the total supply (5 million tokens)
        * Objective: To reward early community members, fostering participation and organic growth.
      * Pre-Sale Fairlaunch
        * Percentage: 50% of the total supply (50 million tokens)
        * Details:
          * Duration: 3 months
          * Fundraising Mechanism:
            * The public fundraising campaign requires a minimum weekly increase of 10% in funds raised.
            * Example: If $100,000 is raised in one week, the following week must reach at least $110,000.
            * If the weekly growth target is not met at any point, the fundraising phase will be terminated immediately, and the tokens will be listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX).
          * Objective: To ensure fairness, stimulate momentum, and create a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in the market.
      * Liquidity Provision
        * Percentage: 20% of the total supply (20 million tokens)
        * Objective: To provide stable liquidity upon the tokenâ€™s listing on a decentralized exchange (DEX), thereby minimizing price volatility.


2.  **Supply Reduction Policy:**&#x20;

    * A key feature of the AIIA tokenomics is the "Buy & Burn" mechanism, designed to reduce the circulating supply of AIIA tokens and potentially increase their value. Once the trading fund raises $2,000,000 and generates surplus profits, AIIA Finance will strategically use a portion of these earnings to buy back AIIA tokens from the market and permanently burn them. This process removes tokens from circulation, potentially increasing the scarcity and value of the remaining tokens. A portion of the fees collected when the PnL (Profit and Loss) is positive will also be used to buy back and burn AIIA tokens. This ties the token burn directly to the platform's profitability, further reinforcing the deflationary aspect.
    * Transparency is paramount. All buy-back and burn transactions will be publicly disclosed, allowing the community to track the token supply and understand the impact of this mechanism on the token's price and intrinsic value.


3. **Use of Raised Capital:**
   * The funds raised through the token sale are strategically allocated to support the project's growth and stability:
     * **Estimated Trading Account** ($10,000,000): This account serves as the core of the profit-generation engine, dedicated to executing quant-driven trading strategies. The capital allocated to this account fuels trading activities that drive the PnL Index and generate returns for investors through systematic and data-driven trading approaches.
     * **Estimated Reserve Fund** ($4,000,000): A reserve fund is crucial for stabilizing the trading account and mitigating potential risks. This fund provides a buffer against market volatility and unforeseen circumstances, ensuring the continuity of trading operations.
     * **On-chain Account**: This account serves as a fully liquid, on-chain reserve, ensuring that investor capital remains readily accessible at all times. Designed to provide maximum flexibility, it allows investors to withdraw their funds instantly without restrictions, offering a seamless and efficient transaction experience within the decentralized ecosystem.
     * **Remaining Funds**: The remaining funds are allocated to essential areas such as marketing, legal compliance, infrastructure development, and team expansion. This includes hiring and retaining talented quant researchers and other key personnel necessary for the project's success. This allocation demonstrates a commitment to building a robust and sustainable platform.
