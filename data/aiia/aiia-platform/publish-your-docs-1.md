# PnL Index represents the Trading Fund’s Performance

The AIIA Finance project utilizes a unique PnL (Profit and Loss) Index, which is directly tied 1:1 to an internal $100,000 trading fund managed by AIIA Finance. This direct correlation means that every fluctuation in the fund's performance is immediately and accurately reflected in the PnL Index. Specifically, each +1 point on the index corresponds to a +1% return calculated based on the $100,000 baseline. The total trading fund of AIIA Finance (with a trading limit of $10,000,000) follows the same portfolio distribution as the internal trading fund, thus achieving similar returns performance, and also reflected by the PnL Index. This PnL index serves as a crucial benchmark for investors, allowing them to easily calculate their potential gains or losses based on the project’s quant-driven trading activities. By providing a clear and readily understandable metric, the PnL Index empowers investors to make informed decisions.
