# Transparency & Independent Audits

Transparency is a cornerstone of the AIIA Finance project. Financial data and the underlying smart contracts are subject to rigorous audits conducted by reputable, independent organizations. These audits serve a crucial purpose: they scrutinize the code for potential vulnerabilities and verify the accuracy of the financial data, significantly mitigating technical and financial risks. This commitment to independent verification enhances investor confidence and bolsters the overall security of the platform. Furthermore, data on the AIIA Finance platform is updated every hour, providing a near real-time view of the project's performance and ensuring ongoing transparency for all stakeholders.
