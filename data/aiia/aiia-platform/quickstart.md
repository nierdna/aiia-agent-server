# Decentralized & Trustless Attributes

AIIA Finance operates on DeFi protocols, a fundamental shift away from traditional finance models. This decentralized structure eliminates the reliance on a central authority or the need for absolute trust in a management team. Instead, the rules and logic governing the platform are encoded in smart contracts, self-executing agreements on the blockchain. This inherent transparency and automation minimize the risk of human error or manipulation, fostering greater trust among participants.
