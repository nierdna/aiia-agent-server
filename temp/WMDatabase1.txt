1. Project Overview
* Name: Whales Market
* Type: Decentralized OTC DEX
* Description: Whales Market is the ultimate OTC decentralized exchange for trading pre-listing allocations. It allows users to directly exchange assets across multiple blockchains with complete trustlessness and security.
* Core Mission: To mitigate risks in peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading by consolidating OTC transactions onto a secure platform. Smart contracts lock funds, releasing them only upon successful transaction settlement to prevent scams and fraud.
* Unique Selling Point: Enables users to trade airdrop allocations even before claiming them.
2. Supported Blockchains
* Primary Token Blockchain: Solana
* Supported Networks:
   * Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Optimism, zkSync, Merlin Chain, Blast, Base, Linea, Mode, Scroll, Taiko, Starknet.
3. Tokenomics
* Ticker: $WHALES
* Total Supply: 100,000,000 tokens
* Blockchain: Solana
* Mint Address: GTH3wG3NErjwcf7VGCoXEXkgXSHvYhx5gtATeeM5JAS1
* Token Allocation:
   1. Incentives: 65% (65,000,000 tokens) - Linear emissions over 4 years, DAO-governed.
   2. Team: 9.5% (9,500,000 tokens) - 0% TGE, locked for 9 months, linear vesting for 36 months.
   3. Liquidity: 7.5% (7,500,000 tokens) - 5% burned on TGE, 2.5% reserved for CEX listing.
   4. Private Sale: 7% (7,000,000 tokens) - 50% TGE, linear vesting for 2 months.
   5. Airdrop: 5% (5,000,000 tokens) - 50% TGE, linear vesting for 12 months.
   6. Marketing: 5% (5,000,000 tokens) - 20% TGE, linear vesting for 24 months.
   7. Security: 1% (1,000,000 tokens) - 100% TGE.


4. Token Utility
Fee Structure:
* Platform fees are utilized as follows:
   1. Revenue-sharing: 60% of fees redistributed to $WHALES stakers.
   2. Development Expenses: 20% allocated to cover ongoing development.
   3. Buyback and Burn: 10% used to buy back and burn tokens.
   4. $LOOT Revenue-sharing: 10% shared with $LOOT stakers and $xLOOT holders.
5. Staking
Overview:
* Stake $WHALES to earn revenue generated from OTC market fees (60% distributed to stakers).
* Staking rewards are issued in $xWHALES, which serves two functions:
   1. Receive revenue share.
   2. Use as collateral in OTC markets.
Mechanics:
* Fees collected in various assets are converted to $WHALES and distributed.
* Dual-Asset Pool: Includes $WHALES and $xWHALES tokens.
* Rewards are paid incrementally to avoid post-claim dumping.
* Stakers can withdraw $xWHALES and convert it back to $WHALES anytime.
Withdrawal:
* No official liquidity pool for $xWHALES on Solana DEX; conversion guaranteed only via Whales staking.
* Rewards do not inflate supply as $WHALES are purchased from the open market.
5. Airdrop and Historical Context
* Airdrop Program:
   * A percentage of $WHALES is retrospectively airdropped to $LOOT stakers and $xLOOT holders upon launch to ensure fair distribution.
* LootBot Context:
   * LootBot was the first project by the Whales Market team, achieving success in 2022.
   * The $WHALES token TGE occurred 11 months and 11 days ago.
6. Features
1. Pre-Markets: Trade token allocations before official Token Generation Events (TGEs).
2. Point Markets: Trade project points convertible to allocations upon TGE.

About Point Markets
* What is Point Market?
   * A marketplace where users trade protocol points in exchange for tokens once they are converted post-TGE.
